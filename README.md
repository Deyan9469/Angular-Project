# Introduction
Hello, this is my Project for Soft-Uni called Art Gallery
# Start up
To start the project you will need:

1. Set 2 terminals - one for folder `project` and another in folder `server`
2. In folder `project` type in terminal `npm install`
3. In folder `server` with the second terminal type `node server`, to start the server
4. In project terminal you can start the project with `npm run start` or `ng serve`
   
From there Angular will generate <http://localhost:4200>, click it and view my project.
